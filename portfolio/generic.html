									<h3 class="major">Archaeologist turned technologist</h3>
									<p>My origin begins in what was a small seaside town in New Jersey, but that's far too early on to start this story. I began serious academic study at the University of Central Florida (UCF). Diving into ethnographies, archaeological surveys, theoretical texts, philosophical texts and all other forms of western perspective on cultural forms. During this time I worked as a mechanical technition converting decommissioned machinery and vehicles into working military simulators; this full-time work with hardware continued off-and-on for years until I completed my studies. </p>
										
									<p>I first graduated with a BA, having focused particularly on cultural and archaeological questions rather than linguistics or biological qquestions. I then worked for a tribal government (Tribal Historic Preservation Office, THPO) as an archaeologist writing technical reports and informing technical maps based on field work my coworkers and I were responsible for, including excavations and pedestrian surveys. This was in some ways more formal than some of the academic field work I had done before- processually, but in terms of scale and organization required for artifact volume and amount of laborers, the academic projects that came before and after this employment was much more intense. I chose to continue studies by pursuing an MA from UCF after working for the THPO, this time with a stronger focus in archaeology.   </p>

									<p>Close to the time I finished my masters I didn't immediately return to archaeology or any form of historic preservation. Instead I returned to the military simulation industry in Research Park, Orlando (close to UCF and the archaeology lab). I didn't return to work with hardware this time, the company that employed me sold software-based product. My responsibility was configuration control and tracking source code, builds, documentation, and rarely hardware. I also led Configuration Control Boards with our customer, the Department of Defense. My next major position was as an archaeological monitor for a pipeline, a position that required greater pay due to greater liability and technical knowledge. It was long, hot days in Arkansas for the length of the project, 2 weeks short of a year. Having saved enough to be comfortable for a few months and the ever increasing presence of disasters I decided to join FEMA's reservist program and help out when I was needed. I hadn't realized until after starting their free coursework that they actually had a position specifically for historic preservation specialists. I continue to hold this position and am happy to have served the Public Assistance program during Hurricane Michael. </p>
